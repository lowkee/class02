    Responsive web design is responsible web design. With the advent of cellphones and other small devices that can surf the Internet, it has become increasingly more difficult to design a web page that can respond to different screen sizes.  Responsive web design makes the page more fluid allowing for the viewer to adjust things to their liking. With responsive design the problems that can arise from different screen sizes, resolutions and different browsers is resolved. A web page that implements responsive design behaves in a responsible manner.  There is no cropping or overlapping. CSS media queries play a major role in establishing a desired response to the viewport(screen size/environment).  All of the elements of the page respond in an orderly manner which is based on how they were written in the HTML, CSS and Javascript.

    Adaptive Web Design aims to achieve the same goal as Responsive web design.  It requires less writing and involves the use of a script to tell the viewers device (phone, tablet, computer) how to display the web page on screens of varying sizes.  Where Adaptive design falls short is that it is rigid. The elements of the page don't always behave to the viewers liking. An example of this would be when resizing your browser and the element contained within whether they be text or images don't all respond with respect to each other.  Sometimes you will try to shrink an image on your screen but the text stays at it's intended pixel size.  This can lead to crowding of elements on a page.  Adaptive web design has rules that are applied based on the screen size and sometimes the outcome of this changes the overall experience of the web page.
